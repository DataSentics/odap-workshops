# MAGIC ### Git as a post service 
# MAGIC When working with a git you can imagine a real-life postal service. All the operations we will be doing will resemble a postal operation. 

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ![github-clone-repo](add-repo-2.png)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Difference between HTTPS and SSH authentication**
# MAGIC - HTTPS is based on user-name and password or PAT tokens. Used for interaction with Git from Databricks.
# MAGIC - SSH is based on private/public key pair. Used usually when interacting with git from your local machine.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In CLI you would do ```git clone https://repo-url.com```

# MAGIC ### Git branches
# MAGIC When working with git you are always developing on a branch. Git branch represents an independent line of development. When working on a new feature or a bug-fix we do not want to keep track of the different changes we are making and we want to keep it separated. Once we are done with our work we want to include these changes into the original repository.  
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Creating a new branch resembles creating a new package in postal service with already prepared content. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Main branch**
# MAGIC In the repository there should always be one main branch which contains the production. This branch is kept protected and no one can push into it directly. Putting changes into this branch is done through pull-requests which will be explained later. The number of protected branches can be higher. For example one branch for development one for testing and one for production.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### To create a new branch for your development:
# MAGIC 1. Click Repos
# MAGIC 2. Click your current repository
# MAGIC ![git-branch-1](git-branch-1)
# MAGIC 3. Click create branch
# MAGIC ![git-branch-1](git-branch-2)
# MAGIC 4. Enter your branch name. In the branch name should be specified to whom the branch belongs and what does it contain. Eg. tbo-person-age-calculation. Based-on tells you on which branch your current branch will be based on. 
# MAGIC 5. Click Create
# MAGIC ![git-branch-1](git-branch-3)
# MAGIC Now you created a new branch and automatically switched your context to it
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In git CLI to create a new branch: ```git checkout -b "branch-name"```

# COMMAND ----------
